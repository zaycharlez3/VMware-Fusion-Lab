# VMware-Fusion-Lab
This repository demonstrates my experience in creating and configuring virtual machines using VMware Fusion. I set up a virtual machine environment transitioning from macOS to Windows, managing virtual networks, and utilizing snapshots and backups for system recovery.

## Tools Used:
- VMware Fusion
- macOS (Host)
- Windows (Guest OS)

## Steps Followed:
1. Installed VMware Fusion on macOS.
2. Created a Windows virtual machine as a guest OS.
3. Configured virtual hardware (CPU, RAM, disk size).
4. Set up virtual networking to simulate different environments.
5. Used snapshots to save system states for backup and recovery.
